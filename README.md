LAP - Raytracing Hardware Accelerator for FPGA
==========

__Brief__: Repository for the raytracing hardware accelerator designed for FPGAs in Chisel at the LAP - EPFL.  

Content
--------
This repository contains both the ***Chisel*** code for the Accelerator and the ***C++*** code for modules generated using Vivado HLS.  
  
This project was my Bachelor Thesis in 2019, and thus I've included the report of the thesis, along with the final presentation and the abstract.
